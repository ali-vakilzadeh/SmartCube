# SmartCube
Programming in Pure Natural Language

**Smart Cubes Project README**

## Overview

Smart Cube is a high-level programming language that operates directly on human natural language, enabling users with zero programming knowledge to create programs using a graphical interface. The project aims to provide a user-friendly and intuitive platform for non-technical users to create complex workflows and interact with AI APIs.

## Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of Smart Cubes are:

* To provide a high-level programming language that operates directly on human natural language
* To enable users with zero programming knowledge to create programs using a graphical interface
* To provide a platform for non-technical users to create complex workflows and interact with AI APIs

## Tech Stack

The Smart Cubes tech stack consists of:

* **Frontend**: React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* **Backend**: Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications
* **Database**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database for storing user data, workflows, and cube configurations
* **AI API Integrations**: OpenRouter, Google Cloud AI, and Microsoft Azure AI (selectable by developer at production stage through project configuration settings)

## Features

* **Graphical Interface**: A user-friendly graphical interface for creating workflows and configuring cubes
* **Natural Language Processing**: Support for natural language processing to enable users to create programs using human language
* **AI API Integration**: Integration with AI APIs to enable users to interact with machine learning models and retrieve results
* **Workflow Management**: A workflow management system for creating, executing, and managing complex workflows

## Requirements

* **Node.js**: Version 16.17.0 or higher
* **MongoDB**: Version 5.0.0 or higher
* **React.js**: Version 18.2.0 or higher
