**Smart Cubes Project Description and Tech Stack**

## I. Introduction

Smart Cubes is a high-level programming language that operates directly on human natural language, enabling users with zero programming knowledge to create programs using a graphical interface. The project aims to provide a user-friendly and intuitive platform for non-technical users to create complex workflows and interact with AI APIs.

## II. Goals and Objectives

The primary goals of Smart Cubes are:

* To provide a high-level programming language that operates directly on human natural language
* To enable users with zero programming knowledge to create programs using a graphical interface
* To provide a platform for non-technical users to create complex workflows and interact with AI APIs

## III. Technology Stack

The Smart Cubes technology stack consists of:

* **Frontend**: React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* **Backend**: Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications
* **Database**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database for storing user data, workflows, and cube configurations
* **AI API Integrations**: OpenRouter, Google Cloud AI, and Microsoft Azure AI (selectable by developer at production stage through project configuration settings)

## IV. System Architecture

The Smart Cubes system architecture consists of the following components:

1. **User Interface**: A React.js-based web application that provides a drag-and-drop canvas for creating workflows and configuring cubes.
2. **Backend**: A Node.js-based server that handles user requests, manages workflows, and interacts with AI APIs.
3. **AI API Integration**: A component that integrates with OpenRouter, Google Cloud AI, and Microsoft Azure AI APIs to execute tasks and retrieve results.
4. **Data Storage**: A MongoDB database that stores user data, workflows, and cube configurations.

## V. Functional Specifications

The Smart Cubes system will have the following functional specifications:

* **Workflow Creation and Management**: Users can create and manage workflows using a drag-and-drop canvas.
* **Cube Configuration and Connection**: Users can configure and connect cubes to create complex workflows.
* **AI API Integration and Task Execution**: The system will integrate with AI APIs to execute tasks and retrieve results.
* **Data Storage and Management**: The system will store and manage user data, workflows, and cube configurations.

## VI. User Experience

The Smart Cubes user experience will be designed to be intuitive and user-friendly. The system will provide:

* **Drag-and-Drop Canvas**: A canvas for creating workflows and configuring cubes.
* **Cube Configuration and Workflow Management**: Users can configure and manage cubes and workflows using a modular interface.
* **Terminal Window**: A terminal window for displaying background AI interactions.

## VII. AI API Integration

The Smart Cubes system will integrate with the following AI APIs:

* **OpenRouter**: A cloud-based AI API for executing tasks and retrieving results.
* **Google Cloud AI**: A cloud-based AI API for executing tasks and retrieving results.
* **Microsoft Azure AI**: A cloud-based AI API for executing tasks and retrieving results.

## VIII. Scalability and Performance

The Smart Cubes system will be designed to be scalable and performant. The system will:

* **Handle Large Volumes of User Data**: The system will be designed to handle large volumes of user data and workflows.
* **Optimize Performance**: The system will be optimized for performance to ensure fast and efficient task execution.

## IX. Security and Data Protection

The Smart Cubes system will be designed with security and data protection in mind. The system will:

* **Store User Data Securely**: The system will store user data securely using encryption and access controls.
* **Protect User Data**: The system will protect user data from unauthorized access and breaches.

## X. Development Roadmap
